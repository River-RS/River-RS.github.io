<h2>About</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to design a professional-looking UI model of a notification center app that actively reads in notifications.
   Our focus is going to be on the front-end of the program, ie, how the program looks, functions, and interacts with the user, not to create a fully-functioning program
   that actively reads in notifications from the backend. While we would love to do that, that is beyond of our skillset and time limit for the semester. We just want a 
   to make beautiful program while learning how to program with UI software more than anything, and we believe we achieved that.</p>
