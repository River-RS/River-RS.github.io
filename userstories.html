<h1>User Stories</h1>
</head>

<h4>Story 1</h4>
<p>As a user, I want the app to be enjoyable to look at so that I am engaged.</p>
<p>Elaboration: While usability is important, we also want users to enjoy our product. That means the colors are readable, the content is appropriately sized and the dimensions for the window to provide enough space to be useful.</p>
<p>Constraints: none</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 8 person-hours</p>
<p>Acceptance Test: Have multiple users test the design for multiple hours Ask for feedback about their experience, emphasizing questions about design. </p>
<br>

<h4>Story 2</h4>
<p>As a user, I want to organize my stuff more easily so that I don’t miss any important info.</p>
<p>Elaboration: I want to be able to see what’s important to me quickly, without a bunch of menu options or loading, and to be able to see a new notification is in without having to read the entire message. This will help me stay on top of what’s important to me without having to switch through multiple windows/applications.</p>
<p>Constraints: Only want to see 4 platforms at a time</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 12 person-hours</p>
<p>Acceptance Test: Have multiple users test the design for multiple hours Ask for feedback about their experience. </p>
<br>

<h4>Story 3</h4>
<p>As an everyday user of my pc, I want my notification center to be customizable so that it is best adapted for my own personal use.
<p>Elaboration: Users should have the ability to customize their notification environment through the GUI so that they can select apps they deem most important to show in the notification area and delete the ones they deem unimportant. This way their stuff is easily accessible to them and highly functional.
<p>Constraints: none</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 8 person hours</p>
<p>Acceptance test: Go through the simple set up of the notification environment and select the apps from the user’s libraries that they want to appear in the notification area. If it works, the apps should appear in the notification area. The user should then attempt to delete an app they do not want pinned to the notification area. If it works, the app should no longer appear in the notification environment.</p>
<br>

<h4>Story 4</h4>
<p>As an everyday user of my pc, I want to be able to access my apps quickly and easily if I get a notification or otherwise. I want to be able to click on the app to see more details about the notification and be able to open the app itself.</p>
<p>Elaboration: Users should be able to easily access the notification environment, and from there have the ability to access their apps quickly and efficiently from the notification environment. They should be able to see all of their most important apps at once, be able to expand said apps to read more about their notifications, and be able to open those apps via the notification environment in some fashion. Ideally, that would involve making the apps clickable.</p>
<p>Constraints: none</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 8 person hours</p>
<p>Acceptance test: Through the GUI, look and see if the apps are clearly visible on the screen. Either hover or click on the apps to see if they expand, and double click the app to open the application.</p>
<br>

<h4>Story 5</h4>
<p>As a user I want an application that can be as unobtrusive or minimal as possible so that the work space isn’t cluttered and I don’t feel interrupted.</p>
<p>Elaboration: The app should up as small amount a space as possible sacrificing other usability as little as possible. Also when notifications come through it shouldn’t interrupt other tasks. I don’t want to have to wait for the notification to go away in order to continue a task (such as getting in the way of another button).</p>
<p>Constraints: none</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 10 person hours</p>
<p>Acceptance test: Ensure that user can correctly interact with the window, throughly debug.</p>
<br>

<h4>Story 6</h4>
<p>As a user I want an app that is easy to navigate so that I spend less time learning about it and more time using it( or less if it is meant to save time).</p>
<p>Elaboration: The application should be easy to set up with tools that make sense. Tabs, or icons should have me readily visualize where I’m navigating to and what contents should be inside. Icons should most likely conform with global standards (like a cogwheel for settings).</p>
<p>Constraints: none</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 7 person hours</p>
<p>Acceptance test: Have users blind react to window, see if the tools are intuitive for new users. If not, then add more instruction</p>
<br>

<h4>Story 7</h4>
<p>As a user I want an application that is easy to access so that I spend less time getting to it.</p>
<p>Elaboration: There are many applications I know of that like to hide themselves and even leave the toolbar when the page is closed but the program is still running (discord does this a lot). An ideal app would have an icon which can be pinned to the toolbar. It would be easy to maximize and minimize from there. Since this application stays on the side of the screen, I would like to be able to hover over a notification to keep it in place or hover over one of the tabs to expand a notification which has already receded into the bar, also clicking on any of the tabs should allow me to gain more information on the notifications. I don’t want to have to dig for anything.</p>
<p>Constraints: none</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 11 person hours</p>
<p>Acceptance test: Make sure that system does not 'lose' the notification window. Either have it open a place in the toolbar or somehow pin it to top of screen.</p>
<br>


<h4>Story 8</h4>
<p>As a user I want to be able to use keyboard shortcuts to move throuh notifications</p>
<p>Elaboration: Some people use keyboard shortcuts to use their computers. Not everyone has to, but I want it to be at least compatible for users that would prefer to use arrow keys/enter key vs a mouse </p>
<p>Constraints: none</p>
<p>Effort Estimation: 3 person hours</p>
<p>Acceptance test: Make sure that different keyboard shortcuts work. If some are not available, provide instructions for user on waht shortcuts are available</p>
