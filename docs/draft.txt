<h4>1. Component Testing</h4>
<br>
<p>Component testing was done by making smaller test of ke cde tasks, such as csv file reading, creating buttons, clicking to exapand buttons, 
implementing a scroll bar, and adding icons to the buttons. Each of these specific tasks were done with smaller code that was run seperatley 
from the final project and developed with simplified problem sets until the mechanics were fully understood and the code was developed enough 
to be grafted to the system.</p>
<br>
<h4>2. System Testing</h4>
<br>
<p>For testing the system, we focused on running relevant pieces of the code and commenting out others until the desired tasks (button "clicks" and 
"unclicks" or scroll bar is sensative to trackpad). This prevented us from trying to fix too many problems at one, and we could identify where 
the issue was much faster. This sort of incremental programming helped keep us on track, although it can take awhile if we wrote a lot of code and 
only tested it at the end.</p>
<br>
<h4>3. Acceptance Testing</h4>
<br>
<p>Describe the system testing that you did that validated if features were considered accepted by the user. Describe how you used the acceptance criteria on 
your user stories to drive your system testing. List your user stories (title only) and state whether or not they are accepted as completely implemented, 
or not.</p>
<br>
<p>Most of this testing was having meetings where teammates used the system and discussed if it was meeting user needs. We highlighted how shortcut-freindly
it was, how helpful the icons were, if the click to exapnd feature was clear enough.</p>
<br>
<p>Story 1 -- readable. Yes, parially implemented, need to consider colors for buttons to be more engaging</p>
<p>Story 2 -- accaptable amt of info. Yes, fully implemented</p>
<p>Story 3 -- customizeable. No, not implemented</p>
<p>Story 4 -- click to take to website. No, not implemented</p>
<p>Story 5 -- nonintrusive design. Yes, fully implemented</p>
<p>Story 6 -- icons. Yes, fully implemented</p>
<p>Story 7 -- window stays on screen. Yes, fully umplemented</p> 
<p>Story 8 -- keyboard shortcuts. Yes, fully implemented</p>
