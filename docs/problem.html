<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
</head>

<body>
<h3>INTRO</h3> 
<p>The problem we are trying to solve is when a user has to switch between multiple windows to track notifications. That has a high chance of becoming
 disorganized leading to missed appointments, assignments, and other important updates. There are notification bars that users can use, however they do
 not allow someone to prioritize certain sources over others, meaning your feed can be filled with notifications for programs you don’t care about, burying
 the ones you need.<p/>
<p>To make this product as useful as possible we assume different states that the user could be in while using our product. 
When they are busy and short on time, they can glance at the short ‘blurb’ of their notification; 
when they have more time, they can expand the notifications for each source and scroll through to see
 ~120 words from each message; and when they are ready to take active steps with each notification, they can click in the tile and be
 taken to the necessary website/application.<p/>

<br> <h3>UNOBTRUSIVE</h3>
<p>Our design will be unobtrusive so that users can easily navigate to the notifications window when they need to see them, but otherwise had an
 unimpeded computer station. The notification central app will have an icon on the taskbar on bottom of screen.<p/>

<br><h3>AT A GLANCE</h3>
<p>Another goal of our project is that the user can, at a quick glance, be up to data about all their notifications. We will accomplish this by having only
 ~35 characters show at a time. </p>

<br><h1>Future work</h1>
<br><h3>CUSTOMIZABLE</h3>
<p>In order to make the product customizable, we will have the user select 4 sources that they consider the most important.  These will be pinned on the
 notification central and will display the most recent notification, the source/brand with logo, time stamp for most recent notification, as well as a
 counter for the number of new notifications.<p/> 

<br><h3>CONTINUALLY UPDATE</h3>
<p>Will continually update notifications. For demo purposes, the notifications are read in from a generated csv file, but in real-life would use API info
 from apps to get actual notifications. <p/>
